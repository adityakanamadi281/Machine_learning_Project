# End-to-End Machine Learning Project 🚀

This repository contains an **end-to-end ML project** implementation with CI/CD pipelines and deployment on AWS.  
The project follows a modular approach for better scalability, reproducibility, and deployment.

---

## 🔧 Project Setup
We use **GitHub** for version control and automation pipelines.

## 📌 Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion**  
   - Collect data from various sources.  
   - Store and organize raw datasets.  

2. **Data Transformation**  
   - Handle missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.  
   - Transform raw data into clean, structured datasets suitable for modeling.  

3. **Model Trainer**  
   - Train machine learning models using transformed data.  
   - Support multiple algorithms and hyperparameter tuning.  

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.  
   - Compare different models to select the best one.  

5. **Model Deployment**  
   - Package the trained model for production use.  
   - Expose model as an API/service for inference.

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline

- **GitHub Actions** is used for automation:
  - Code linting & testing
  - Continuous Integration (CI)
  - Continuous Deployment (CD)  

---

## ☁️ Deployment

- The final model is deployed on **AWS** for scalability and reliability.  
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) can be used to automate deployments.
